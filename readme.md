# ColorfulNote

ColorfulNote is an desktop app that converts music into art in real time. It is a 15112F17 Term Project.

## Getting Started

To use ColorfulNote, you need to have python3 with the required modules.

### Prerequisites

* python version >= 3.5   
* matplotlib >= 2.1.0
* tkinter >= 8.5
* PIL >= 1.1.7
* pyAudio >= 0.2.11

You can check the version of your python by typing in the terminal:


```
which python
```


Or if you have multiple versions of python:

```
which python3
```

If you are using Anaconda python, you can check the versions of all your installed packages by typing:

```
conda list
```

### Installing Modules

If you have multiple versions of python installed, it is recommended that you create a virtual environment named "ColorfulNote" using Anaconda, and install all the required packages in that virtual environment. Also, to ensure a successful installation, make sure you have correctly configured your Python shell to run in the environment with all packages.

To create a virtual environment in Anaconda:

```
conda create --name myenv
```

To activate the virtual environment:

```
conda activate myenv
```

## Robustness
* works great
* used Delta Graphics to speed up graphing
* helpers and drawing objects are very customizable and reusable

## Complexity
* real time sound capturing integrated with tkinter framework
* self-written sound analysis for pitch detection, strength detection, tone variation
* self-written GUI widgets (buttons and menu classes)
* self-written drawing helpers that draw ring objects using polar coordinate and trignomotry

## User Experience
* pretty color scheme
* intuitive file saving
